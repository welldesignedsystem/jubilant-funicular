# Jublient Funicular

## Steps:
1. Create a document with the hull assembly page.
2. used the prompt - 
```text
Using the uploaded document as reference material, generate a Business Requirements Document in Markdown format for a generic, reusable shipyard hull fabrication and assembly project management system.

Requirements for the output:

- All phases and stages must be treated as configurable — the system requirements should explicitly support adding, removing, and reordering phases without structural changes.
- All specific values in the source document (names, dates, durations, percentages, company names) are mock data only — do not treat them as fixed requirements. The BRD must be written generically so it applies to any project of this type.
- Where helpful, reference values from the document as illustrative examples to clarify or substantiate a requirement (e.g., "for example, a two-day supplier delay may be logged as a baseline change"), but make clear they are examples, not specifications.
- The document should cover: executive summary, business objectives, scope, stakeholder roles, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, assumptions & constraints, and a glossary.
- Stakeholder entries should be role-based, not named individuals.
- Close the document with a disclaimer stating all examples are illustrative and should be replaced before formal use.
